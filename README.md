# Data science Portfolio

Hi, my name is Alexander and I am currently a 4th year student studying statistics at SFU. This is where I will be uploading my academic and personal projects. Thanks for spending the time to visit my github

## R
### Predicting House Sales in King Country
In this project, I collaborated with two classmates to clean and analyze a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) from Kaggle to predict house sales. We created a multiple linear regression model and compared the results using LASSO, Ridge, Stepwise, Forwards, and Backwards feature selection techniques. Our findings were summarised and presented in an executive report and powerPoint presentation to a class of 70 students.
