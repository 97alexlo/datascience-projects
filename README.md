# Data Science Portfolio by Alexander Lo

Hi, my name is Alexander and I'm currently studying statistics at SFU. This is my profolio where I will be uploading my projects. I am constantly trying to improve my data analysis skills and hoping to create better projects in the future. Thanks for reading!

### Exploratory Data Analysis of Marvel Universe Cinematic films from 2008 - 2019
In this project, I analyzed, scraped, cleaned, merged, and transform HTML tables from Wikipedia of MCU films. I decided to do this project because I'm a fan of their movies and was curious about their popularity worldwide.
