# Data Science Portfolio by Alexander Lo

Hi, my name is Alexander and I'm currently studying statistics at SFU. This is my profolio where I will be uploading my projects. I am constantly trying to improve my data analysis skills and hoping to create better projects in the future. Thanks for reading

### (May 2019) Exploratory Data Analysis of Marvel Universe Cinematic films from 2008 - 2019
In this project, I analyzed, scraped, cleaned, and merged, data tables from Wikipedia of MCU films. I decided to do this project because I'm a fan of their movies and was curious their worldwide popularity.

The goal of this project is to scrape and clean text data (ex. Professor's name, exam locations, course ID, textbooks) from SFU's course outline webpages and display them in a table.

### (March 2019) Shiny app - Climate change in BC from 1979 - 2017
This is a shiny app I made in STAT 240 at SFU. In this project, I customized the layout of my shiny app with buttons that plots different curves/lines.
