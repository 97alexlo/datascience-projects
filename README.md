### National Case Study Competition: BC Ferries delay prediction
This was the first time I participated in a national [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/canssi-ncsc-ferry-delays/overview). It was hosted by CANSSI (Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute) and the goal was to analyze and predict sailing delays between Vancouver and Victoria. This contest is open to all graduate and undergraduate students across Canada. In this project, I merged and transformed data sets and create models with logistic regression and XGBoost. I was placed 24th and I really enjoyed this competition because it pushed me to learn a lot on my own.

### Predicting House Sales in King Country
In this project, I collaborated with two classmates to clean and analyze a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) to predict house sales. We created a multiple linear regression model and compared the results using LASSO, Ridge, Stepwise, Forwards, and Backwards feature selection techniques. Our findings were summarised and presented in an executive report and powerPoint presentation to a class of 70 students.

### Analysis of Marvel Universe Cinematic films from 2008 - 2019
In this project, I scraped and analyzed data from [Wikipedia's webpage of MCU films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films). I created a variety visualizations and to find trends in the data.

### Twitter (and Sentiment) Analysis of Donald Trumpâ€™s tweets
In this project, I collected data from Donald Trump's twitter with an API. Using the data, I performed text preprocessing and exploratory analysis to draw insights on his tweeting behaviour

### SFU Course Outline Webscraper
This is a project from STAT 240 where I created webscraper that cleans and collects relevant course information from SFU's webpages (ex. Professor's name, exam locations, course ID, textbooks)

### My first Shiny app - Climate change in BC from 1979 - 2017
This is the first shiny app I created. I customized the layout along with buttons that plots different curves/slopes with the data sets provided by Dr. Campbell
